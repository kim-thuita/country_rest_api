# Country_Rest_Api

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

-This project is a rest api that fetched data of countries and shows various data such as the flag and their population.

- I used Flutter dart to complete the task.
- Some of the challenges i faced is use integrating a search list and a filter i tried using a search delegate but was not able to solve them.
- If i had more time i would use features such as the filter and the a search list.
- 
-The libraries that i used is a http package that allows you to use the api URl in order to fetch data from the server
